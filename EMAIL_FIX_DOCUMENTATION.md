# Email Configuration Issues Fixed

## The Problem

Emails weren't being sent after booking due to two main issues:

1. **Unverified Domain**: The email configuration was trying to send emails from `bookings@easeway-medicare.co.uk`, but this domain was not verified in Resend.
2. **Testing Restrictions**: Resend restricts testing accounts to only send emails to the account owner's verified email address.

## The Solution

### 1. Updated Email Configuration

- Changed the `from` address to use Resend's verified testing domain: `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Updated admin email to the verified account email: `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com`

### 2. Environment Variables Fixed

- The issue was caused by multiple environment files with different priorities
- `.env.development.local` (created by Vercel CLI) was overriding the `.env` file
- Updated the correct environment file with the proper admin email

### 3. Current Working Configuration

```bash
# In .env.development.local
ADMIN_EMAIL="4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_WwxhxFpZ_EyyP7uTGsDM5SAozEvGQPJ3T"
EMAIL_SERVICE="resend"
```

## For Production Deployment

### Option 1: Use Testing Configuration (Current)

- Emails will be sent from `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Both admin and patient emails will go to `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com`
- This works immediately but is not ideal for production

### Option 2: Verify Domain in Resend (Recommended for Production)

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add and verify the domain `easeway-medicare.co.uk`
3. Update the email configuration to use:
   ```typescript
   from: "Easeway Medicare <bookings@easeway-medicare.co.uk>";
   ```
4. Set the admin email back to: `admin@easeway-medicare.co.uk`

### Option 3: Use SMTP Fallback

- Configure SMTP credentials for the domain email provider
- The system will automatically fall back to SMTP if Resend is not available

## Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel dashboard:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin email address for notifications
- `EMAIL_SERVICE`: "resend" (default)

## Testing Results

✅ Admin notification emails: Working
✅ Patient confirmation emails: Working
✅ Error handling: Proper fallback when email fails
✅ Email service detection: Automatic

Both email types are now being sent successfully with unique tracking IDs.
