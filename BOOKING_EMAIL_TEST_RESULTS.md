### ✅ TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

I have thoroughly tested the booking email delivery system for Easeway Medicare Physiotherapy Clinic. Here are the findings:

---

### 🎯 **CURRENT CONFIGURATION STATUS**

- **✅ Admin Email Configured:** `easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk`
- **✅ Resend API:** Working with valid API key
- **✅ Email Service:** Properly configured
- **✅ Booking System:** Functional and sending emails

---

### 📧 **CURRENT EMAIL DELIVERY BEHAVIOR**

When a booking is completed successfully:

1. **✅ Admin Notification Email:**

   - **Intended Recipient:** `easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk`
   - **Actual Delivery:** `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com` (due to Resend testing mode)

   - **Status:** ✅ Successfully delivered

---

### ⚠️ **CURRENT LIMITATION**

The Resend account is in **testing mode**, which means:

- All emails are redirected to the account owner: `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com`
- Emails cannot be sent directly to `easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk`
- This is a standard Resend security feature for unverified domains

---

### 🔧 **SOLUTIONS FOR PRODUCTION**

#### **OPTION A: Domain Verification (RECOMMENDED)**

1. Visit [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add and verify domain: `easewaymedicare.co.uk`
3. Add DNS records as instructed by Resend
4. Once verified, emails will be delivered directly to `easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk`

#### **OPTION B: Email Forwarding (IMMEDIATE SOLUTION)**

1. Set up automatic forwarding in Gmail:
   - From: `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com`
   - To: `easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk`
2. No code changes needed
3. All booking notifications will automatically forward

#### **OPTION C: Update Environment Variable**

1. Change `ADMIN_EMAIL` in production environment to: `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com`
2. Set up manual forwarding process
3. Revert once domain is verified
