# Stage 7: Admin Dashboard Calendar & Schedule Management

## Overview

The admin dashboard now includes a comprehensive calendar/schedule management system that allows administrators to view all bookings in a visual calendar format and manage time slot availability by blocking/unblocking specific slots.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Calendar/Schedule View

- **Visual Calendar**: Week and day view options for viewing bookings
- **Interactive Time Slots**: Click-to-interact slots for management
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- **Navigation**: Easy week/day navigation with "Go to Today" button
- **Color-coded Status**: Visual indicators for different booking and slot states

### 2. Slot Management System

- **Click to Block**: Click empty slots to block them with custom reasons
- **Click to Unblock**: Click blocked slots to remove the block
- **Reason Tracking**: Require and store reasons for blocking slots
- **Conflict Prevention**: Cannot block slots that already have bookings
- **Database Persistence**: All blocked slots stored in database

### 3. Visual Indicators

- **Booking Status Colors**:
  - Green: Confirmed bookings
  - Yellow: Pending bookings
  - Red: Cancelled bookings
  - Blue: Completed bookings
- **Blocked Slots**: Gray background with block icon and reason
- **Available Slots**: White background with "Click to block" hint
- **Past Slots**: Dimmed and non-interactive

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

- **Detailed Information**: Booking cards show patient name, service, confirmation number
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful degradation
- **Accessibility**: Proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

New `BlockedSlot` model added to Prisma schema:

```prisma
model BlockedSlot {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  date      String   // Format: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  time      String   // Format: "HH:MM"
  reason    String   // Reason for blocking the slot
  createdBy String   // User ID of admin who created the block
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  user      User     @relation(fields: [createdBy], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([date, time]) // Ensure no duplicate blocks for same date/time
}
```

### API Endpoints

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Booking System Integration

- Blocked slots are hidden from public booking form
- Available slots API considers blocked slots
- Real-time synchronization between admin actions and user view
- Prevents double-booking of blocked slots

### Settings Integration

- Works alongside existing clinic settings (hours, breaks, working days)
- Database-level blocks override settings-based availability
- Maintains existing blocked periods from clinic settings
- Consistent time slot generation logic

### Notification Integration

- Admin actions logged and tracked
- Blocked slots include creator information
- Audit trail for slot management activities

## Security & Access Control

### Authentication Requirements

- All blocked slot APIs require admin authentication
- Role-based access control (admin only)
- User tracking for blocked slot creation
- Session validation for all operations

### Data Validation

- Date format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Time format validation (HH:MM)
- Conflict checking (no blocking existing bookings)
- Duplicate prevention (unique date/time constraint)

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of invalid requests
- Clear error messages for users
- Non-blocking failures (calendar still works if API fails)
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Data Loading

- Paginated booking queries when needed
- Date-based filtering for blocked slots
- Optimized database queries with proper indexes
- Minimal data transfer for calendar updates

### Client-side Optimizations

- Efficient re-rendering with React keys
- Debounced auto-refresh to prevent excessive API calls
- Lazy loading of detailed booking information
- Optimistic updates for better user experience

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### API Testing

```bash
# Test blocked slots API (requires admin auth)
GET /api/admin/blocked-slots
POST /api/admin/blocked-slots
DELETE /api/admin/blocked-slots

# Test enhanced available slots
GET /api/available-slots?date=2025-08-18
```

### Functional Testing

1. **Block Empty Slot**: Verify slot becomes blocked and hidden from users
2. **Unblock Slot**: Verify slot becomes available again
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Ensure can't block slots with existing bookings
4. **Calendar Navigation**: Test week/day switching and date navigation
5. **Real-time Updates**: Verify auto-refresh functionality

### User Experience Testing

- Mobile responsiveness across devices
- Touch interaction on mobile
- Keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Screen reader compatibility
- Performance under load

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Migration

- Run `npx prisma db push` to apply BlockedSlot schema
- Verify database indexes for performance
- Backup existing data before deployment

### Environment Setup

- No additional environment variables required
- Uses existing authentication system
- Compatible with existing email notification system

### Monitoring

- Monitor API response times for calendar loads
- Track blocked slot creation/deletion patterns
- Monitor admin dashboard usage metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
