## üîß URGENT: Domain Verification Required

### Current Status: New Account Still in Testing Mode

Your new Resend account (easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk) is working but still has testing restrictions:

- ‚úÖ Admin emails: Delivered to easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk
- ‚ùå Patient emails: Blocked (can't send to customer email addresses)

### üöÄ IMMEDIATE FIX: Verify Domain

#### Step 1: Log into Resend Dashboard

- Go to [resend.com/login](https://resend.com/login)
- Login with: `easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk`

#### Step 2: Add Domain

1. Click "Domains" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `easewaymedicare.co.uk`
4. Click "Add Domain"

#### Step 3: DNS Configuration

Resend will provide DNS records like:

```
Type: TXT
Name: _resend
Value: resend-verify=abc123...
```

Add these to your domain's DNS settings through your hosting provider.

#### Step 4: Verify Domain

- Wait for DNS propagation (usually 5-15 minutes)
- Click "Verify Domain" in Resend dashboard

### ‚úÖ AFTER VERIFICATION:

- All booking emails (admin + patient) will be delivered
- No more testing mode restrictions
- Professional email addresses can be used

### üß™ CURRENT TEST RESULTS:

```bash
# This WORKS (admin email)
curl -X POST "https://api.resend.com/emails" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer re_5B6gPvnP_D6D6ksyhMWQJtx3QLxrUcZFY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  "from": "onboarding@resend.dev",
  "to": "easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk",
  "subject": "Admin Test",
  "text": "This works!"
}'

# This FAILS (customer email - testing mode)

-d '{
  "from": "onboarding@resend.dev",
  "to": "customer@example.com",
  "subject": "Patient Test",
  "text": "This fails in testing mode"
}'
```
