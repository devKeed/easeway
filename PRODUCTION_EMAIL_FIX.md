# Production Email Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Build Error - Invalid URL

**Problem**: `TypeError: Invalid URL` during build process
**Root Cause**: Environment variables in production were missing the `https://` protocol
**Solution**: Made URL construction more robust in `app/layout.tsx` and `lib/email.ts` to handle URLs with or without protocols

### 2. Production Environment Variables

**Problem**: Production environment variables had incorrect values:

- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: "admin@easeway-medicare.co.uk" (unverified domain)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: "http://localhost:3001" (localhost URL)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: "http://localhost:3001" (localhost URL)

## Code Changes Made

### 1. `/app/layout.tsx` - Robust URL Handling

```typescript
metadataBase: new URL(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL?.startsWith('http')
    ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
    : `https://${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 'easewaymedicare.co.uk'}`
),
```

### 2. `/lib/email.ts` - Fixed Admin Dashboard URL

```typescript
<a href="${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL?.startsWith('http')
  ? process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL
  : `https://${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'easewaymedicare.co.uk'}`}/admin/dashboard"
```

## Required Vercel Environment Variable Updates

You need to update these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

### Production Environment Variables:

```
ADMIN_EMAIL=4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://easewaymedicare.co.uk
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://easewaymedicare.co.uk
RESEND_API_KEY=re_WwxhxFpZ_EyyP7uTGsDM5SAozEvGQPJ3T
EMAIL_SERVICE=resend
```

## How to Update Vercel Environment Variables

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (easeway)
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Update the following variables for **Production** environment:
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` â†’ `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` â†’ `https://easewaymedicare.co.uk`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` â†’ `https://easewaymedicare.co.uk`

### Option 2: Vercel CLI

```bash
# Remove old variables
vercel env rm NEXTAUTH_URL production
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL production

# Add correct variables
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL production
# Enter: https://easewaymedicare.co.uk

vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL production
# Enter: https://easewaymedicare.co.uk
```

## Email Configuration Status

### Current Working Configuration:

- âœ… **Resend API**: Working with correct API key
- âœ… **From Address**: Using `onboarding@resend.dev` (verified testing domain)
- âœ… **Admin Email**: `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com` (verified recipient)
- âœ… **Patient Email**: Goes to user's input email (validated by Resend)

### After Environment Variable Update:

- Both admin and patient confirmation emails will work in production
- Admin will receive booking notifications at `4tuneadebiyi@gmail.com`
- Patients will receive confirmation emails at their provided email addresses

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the code changes** (the build error is now fixed)
2. **Update environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Test the booking flow** in production
4. **Verify emails are received** for both admin and patient

## Future Improvements for Production

1. **Verify Custom Domain in Resend**:

   - Add `easeway-medicare.co.uk` in Resend dashboard
   - Update email configuration to use professional email addresses

2. **Professional Email Addresses**:
   ```typescript
   from: "Easeway Medicare <bookings@easeway-medicare.co.uk>";
   adminEmail: "admin@easeway-medicare.co.uk";
   ```

The application is now ready for production deployment with working email notifications! ðŸš€
