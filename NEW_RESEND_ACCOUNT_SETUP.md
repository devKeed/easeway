## ðŸ”§ PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT SETUP GUIDE

### New Resend Account Configuration

After creating the new Resend account with `easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk`:

#### **Update .env file:**

```bash
# Replace the current RESEND_API_KEY with the new one
RESEND_API_KEY="re_NEW_API_KEY_FROM_PRODUCTION_ACCOUNT"

# Keep the admin email the same
ADMIN_EMAIL="easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk"

# Other settings remain the same
EMAIL_SERVICE="resend"
```

#### **Domain Verification (Optional but Recommended):**

1. In your new Resend dashboard, go to Domains
2. Add domain: `easewaymedicare.co.uk`
3. Add the DNS records provided by Resend
4. Once verified, you can use: `from: "Easeway Medicare <easeway.physiotherapy@easewaymedicare.co.uk>"`
